## Blackjack-Game
This is a prject that I worked on to apply what I have been learning in Java. I focused mainly on the use of different classes, abstraction, and inheritance. There are a total of 8 classes that I use including the main class, with 2 of those being abstract classes, and almost all using inheritance to create a heirarchy of classes. I use the classes to split up and organize the work. For example, there is a class named Card, that focuses on the identity of a card. There is also then a class called GenericPlayer, which is an abstract class that outlines the function of a player. GenericPlayer is then made the parent for the player classes, House and Player, for the dealer and user player respectively.
